# node-babysteps
A holding area for my NodeJS building blocks

WHY?
====

Programs are not intelligent but instead really stupid employees that are only good at following very specific instructions. The smaller the building blocks or set of instructions that the employee uses, the better and more explicit our code becomes. 

This is a repo for my building blocks as I understand them currently. This code is not perfect nor should it be used without fixing it. If you do find any errors, please point them out and if it is a stupid error, please tell me so I can make better development choices in the future. 

All Pull requests are wanted!
