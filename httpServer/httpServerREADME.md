WHAT'S THIS?
============

`simpleServer.js`

* Creates a _very_ simple server, `listening` on `port 8080`
* When someone wants to interact with the server, it runs the `callback()` function
* `callbac()` takes two arguments: `request` and `response`
* I uses the `response` argument to create a response to give to whatever is interacting with the server
